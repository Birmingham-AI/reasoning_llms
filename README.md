# Reasoning LLMs

## Overview

This session is a deep dive into reasoning models, focusing on their capabilities and applications. We will explore the
DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model (also one from Ollama) and test it with a series of expert-level questions to evaluate its performance.

- Understand the underlying mechanisms of reasoning models.
- Evaluate the performance of DeepSeek-R1 with expert-level questions.
- Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the model.
